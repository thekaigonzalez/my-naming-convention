here are my C naming conventions

note:

        a lot of them are lowercase, i like the lowercase aesthetic better than
        the uppercase one

naming:

        Struct                  can be either Uppercase or lowercase, underlines
                                aren't required

        Struct Members          If members won't be exposed to the user, prefix them with '__'
        
        Local Variables         [a-z] or __[a-z]
        Global Variables        never
        Constant Variables      FULL_CASE_AND_UNDERLINED

        Pointers                depends on the kind of pointer - if it's a
                                CONSTANT pointer then you could possibly use Uppercase, it depends on
                                the mutability of the referenced data point
                                itself.
                                
        Enums                   [default]s (add the s to the end in most cases)
        
        Defines                 UPPERCASE (W/ UNDERLINE)

        Functions               Depends on if they are exposed externally, if
                                they're helper functions then they will be prefixed with either one or
                                two underlines. otherwise they're normal C
                                naming.
